Tips and Tricks to pass the AWS associate certifications

disclaimer: I have passed the aws associate architect and aws associate developer exam and the below given advice is what worked for me and hence is by no means a fail proof way to pass the aws certifications for everyone. But if my advice did help you in some way, I would love to hear about it!

How many associate exams are there?

There are 3 aws associate exams:
1. AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate
2. AWS Certified Developer – Associate
3. AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate

Which exam do I need and which exam should I write first?

AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate makes you eligible to sit for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional one.

AWS Certified Developer – Associate and/or AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate makes you eligible to sit for the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional one.

All three associate exams have a lot of topics in common of which the architect one is rumoured to have the most depth and difficulty and developer one to be the easiest. It was true in my case. Hence in my personal opinion, if you prepare for the toughest one, you can pass the other ones with very little preparation.

How much preparation time do I need?

It varies from person to person. But here is a rough guide. Assuming that you have atleast an year of experience in AWS and that you have full time job and also dont want to use all of your weekends doing just this, I estimate 4 weeks to do 2 certifications. 

How do I register for the exam?

You should first create an aws certification account https://www.aws.training/Account/LogOnOptions

What preparation materials do I use?

1. Start with the exam blue print provided by Amazon: https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS_certified_solutions_architect_associate_blueprint.pdf

This gives you a general idea of the topics you have to cover.

2. Have a aws account to play around with and get familiar

3. Do a practise test on https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate to see where you stand. acloudguru has good study materials and practise papers that help prepare you well.

4. There are a lot of things to remember for the exam and if you think you do better with diagrams, use 
https://linuxacademy.com/amazon-web-services/training/course/name/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associates

Their practise exams are great as well.

5. Read all the  FAQs of relevant AWS components atleast once. eg: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/

6. Do as many sample question papers as possible and leave the one that comes with registering your certification account for the very end. The sample paper provided by amazon when you register is usually tougher than the actual exam itself and if you pass that paper it almost guarantees that you are well ready for the main exam. Make sure you time yourself on all the questions you do.

when will I get the result?

Immediately after you submit your test. 

What is the pass mark?

AWS does not publish a pass markas the answers are decided by statistical analysis. From my personal experience if you have above 70%, you are most likey to pass. But 80% is always the safe bet and aim higher for the practise papers to guarantee the same.

What if I fail?

You can always retake the exam , 14 days after yor first attempt.

How long is my certification valid for?

2 years

Some personal tips:

* Take the exam during the time of the day when you feel you are most alert
* Most questions are really long and hence if you feel you have no clue about the question in the first read, flag it and come back to it later
* If you have a long question, read the full question once and then only re read the last one or two lines as the real question lies there.
* Practise the art of elimination! :) Eliminate the options that you are sure are not correct
* Attempt all questions as there are no negative marks
